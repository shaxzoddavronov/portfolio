                     Bank Customer Segmentation:
                     - Most banks have a large customer base - with different characteristics in terms of age, 
                     income, values, lifestyle, and more. \n 
                     Customer segmentation is the process of dividing 
                     a customer dataset into specific groups based on shared traits.
                     - According to a report from Ernst & Young, â€œA more granular understanding of consumers is 
                     no longer a nice-to-have item, \n 
                     but a strategic and competitive imperative for banking providers.
                     Customer understanding should be a living, breathing \n
                     part of everyday business, with insights 
                     underpinning the full range of banking operations.
